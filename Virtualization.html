    <h1> Virtualization </h1>
    <p>In computing, <b>virtualization</b> refers to the act of creating a virtual <i>(rather than actual)</i> version of something, this includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
<ol>


      <li><b>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Level</b> </li>
        <p>Every machine has an instruction set . This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware. Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.</p>

      <li><b>Virtualization at Operating System (O.S.) Level</b></li>
        <p>In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>
            <li>So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware. </li>
          </ul>
</ol>
